### Problem Formulation Steps (Thinks on design a system perspective)
---

+ Design optimization is the selection of the best design within the available means

#### Steps
*****

+ **Decision Variable:** Select design variables (Variable which I can decide/manipulate)
+ **Objective Function:** Select objective criterion in terms of design variables (to minimize or maximize)
+ **Constraints:** Determine constraints in terms of design variables, which must be satisfied (what will prevent variable manipulation )
+ **Problem Solution:** Determine design variable values which minimize (maximize) the objective while satisfying all constraints
